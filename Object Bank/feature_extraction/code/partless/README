PARTLESS OBJECTBANK RELEASE

getfeat_single_image takes in FOUR parameters:
1. imagepath: path of the image
2. outputfilename: filename of the output (without extension)
3. outputpath: parent directory of the output
4. savermap: boolean variable; 1 means save and 0 means not save.

By default,
imagepath=ImageSet/1.jpg
outputfilename=tmp
outputpath=NULL
savermap=0

Make sure to use resize_img function to resize all the images in the dataset so that minimum side is 400.

To run the default setting, run 'getfeat_single_image' in MATLAB. Otherwise, modify the imagepath, outputfilename, and/or outputpath (if outputpath does not exists, the code will automatically try to make a new one).

The features for the sample images in ImageSet folder are saved in Feature folder. Use these to test whether your code is properly running.

If the responsemap needs to be saved, set the fourth parameter to 1 (in fact, any non-empty string).

The object names can be looked up in objectlist.txt and scene names can be looked up in scenelist.txt.

The current object order is in detectorset.m.

This code for research purpose and is not fully optimized.
