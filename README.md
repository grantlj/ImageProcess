# ImageProcess

My work in Image Processing and Computer Vision fields. 

##ActionRecognition
An direct demo of Caltech101 dataset's recognition implementation.

##De-Fog(under construction)
I wanna to realize the well-known algorithm put forward in *Single Image Haze Removal Using Dark Channel Prior*

##FaceDetectorWithPCA_SVM
An implemention of face detecting algorithm using Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and Support Vector Machine(SVM). This tiny project inspire
my interest in CV.

##KTHActionRecognition
A lot of implemention of the present popular algorithms and their combined pipelines on Action Recognition task.

##MyFlower
The project for Microsoft ImagineCup Competition. Want to recognize flowers on your mobile phone? Under the most heated 
Convolutional Neural Netwrok(CNN), the recognizing rate is over 80%!

##OBBench/OBMED/Object Bank
For research use, we put forward a new algorithm on action recognition tasks. The codes are respectively written for two popular dataset
(HMDB51 and TRECVID MED)

##TrafficLightDetection(Under construction)
The system written meant to detect traffic lights and distint their colour in few seconds. We are trying to use improved Hough-
Transform to solve it. This project is supported by **National Training Programs of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates**


##YLY
Some experiments working for Luyu Yang's paper.

*Note: There also contains some scattered .m files in this repository. Most of them are early sketeches and exercises for basic
Image Processing issues.*

Thanks very much for [Prof. Chenqiang Gao]'s guidance in my research work!
